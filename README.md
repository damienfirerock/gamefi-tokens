This is a small repo to make interactions with a multisig wallet more user-friendly.
It should allow users to:

- Confirm/Revoke/Execute transactions via Metamask
- Send Confirm/Revoke/Execute signatures to the backend for a wallet to execute the transactions on behalf of the user
- Show relevant details of current/past transactions

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Sample env file

## Packages used

- Material UI (https://mui.com/) for quick styling (MUI used emotion as a dependency)
- Redux (specifically https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) for global state management
- ethersjs (https://docs.ethers.org/v5/) to read blockchain data, work with browser wallets, and submit transactions to the network
- 0xsequence (https://docs.sequence.xyz/quickstart) as an browser wallet which should hopefully remove the need for a browser extension wallet

## Global State Management

- Transactions Slice: This is mainly for showing errors from Metamask (i.e. 'User rejects signing')
- Multisig Slice: This is for managing requests wherein signatures are sent to the backend for the hot wallet to run the transaction

## Frontend

- This is a very simple app with only one main page (MultiSig.tsx)

## Backend (WIP)

- Working on: https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction (so that a separate BE repo will not be required)
